    /* //Creating Variables
    There are several variable data types, but the primary ones are:
    -int        (A whole number)
    -double     (A number with a decimal place or extends out of integer boundaries)
    -String     (Written characters; name, phrase, etc.)
    -Char       (an individual character)
    -boolean    (a value of true or false)
    -Object     (we will get to Objects in a different section)

    Each of the numeric data types has their own boundaries:
    -byte       =   0 to 255
    -sbyte      =   -128 to 127
    -short      =   -32,768 to 32,767
    -ushort     =   0 to 65,535
    -int        =   -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
    -uint       =   0 to 4,294,967,295
    -long       =   
    -ulong      =   
    -float      =   
    -double     =   
    -decimal    =   
    
    Knowing how much memory is being alloted for what variables
        doesn't necessarily take a toll within small projects,
        but on a massive scale, allotting more memory to hold a
        variable that doesn't use it all will eventually depreciate
        the efficiency of the program
